We’re still far from what IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md describes. Right now the app is being propped up by a thin mock layer and most of the real infrastructure—Redux slices, database/pack manager, audio/download services, screens, navigation flows—was removed. The editor keeps complaining because those files truly are missing. To reach the spec (and support real data later), we need to rebuild the foundation.

### Suggested Recovery Plan

1. **Restore Core State Structure**
   - Recreate `src/store/slices` for `app`, `settings`, `content`, `progress`, and `audio`, matching the types/interfaces in the plan.
   - Re-export typed hooks (`useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector`) and selectors for Smart Next, etc.
   - Wire persistence (MMKV or AsyncStorage via redux-persist).

2. **Bring Back Content/Data Services**
   - Rebuild `services/content`:
     - `packManager.ts` to manage pack manifests/activation.
     - `contentRepository.ts` with selectors.
     - `contentService.ts` that can switch between mock data and real DB.
   - Reintroduce `services/db` (SQLite schema, migrations, seed). For now, implement a basic `database.ts` with `expo-sqlite` stubs that return mock data but follow the real API (so you can swap in actual database calls later).

3. **Navigation & Screens**
   - Use React Navigation stacks/tabs exactly as outlined:
     - Home, Learn stack (Vocabulary + Phrases), Hundred Seconds, Search, Settings, About.
   - Replace the placeholder screens with proper components that read from the restored store/services. You currently have two competing screen sets (`src/features` vs `src/screens`); consolidate into the new structure.

4. **Audio & Downloads**
   - Reintroduce `services/audio/audioService.ts` wrapping `react-native-track-player`.
   - Rebuild `useAudioPlayback`, `useDownloadPolicy`, etc.
   - Stub download manager logic under `services/fs` so the UI can interact even if actual downloads aren’t implemented yet.

5. **Content Loading Workflow**
   - In `AppProviders`, bootstrap by:
     - Initializing the DB (`databaseService.init()`).
     - Loading the active pack via `packManager`.
     - Dispatching `setTopics`, `setModuleAvailability`, `setVocabulary`, etc., with real data or well-structured mocks.
   - Provide a toggle (env/config) to swap between mock and DB-backed content.

6. **UI Components**
   - Recreate common UI (ProgressRing, CTAButton, AppScaffold) as described in plan to avoid missing imports and align design.

7. **Cleanup & Tooling**
   - Remove leftover mock-only files once real flow works.
   - Ensure `tsconfig`/Babel aliases match final structure.
   - Add lint/test scripts back.

Because this is a large rebuild, here’s where to start concretely:

- **Step 1:** Restore store slices (create new files in `src/store/slices`) with interfaces matching the implementation plan; adjust `store/index.ts` accordingly.
- **Step 2:** Recreate `services/content/packManager.ts` and `services/db/database.ts` based on the old code or the plan’s specs (even if they return mock data for now). Update `HomeScreen` and other components to use new selectors.
- **Step 3:** Consolidate screen directories: move everything to `src/features/...` per plan, delete obsolete `src/screens/...` files, and fix imports.
- **Step 4:** Add `audioService` and related hooks so `ReadingScreen` (and others) compile.
- **Step 5:** Replace `loadMockContent` call with the actual initialization pipeline.

Once these steps are in place, we can start feeding real content (XML → JSON/SQLite) and building out Smart Next, downloads, etc.

Let me know where you’d like me to dive in first—store slices, content services, or screen consolidation.
